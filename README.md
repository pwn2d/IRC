# IRC
internet chat relay

the last one didn't work so i updated it, this one however doesn't have any encryption like the last one but i plan on adding that soon...

usage :

1.  start the server -> python [server.py] [number of connections] [server ip address]
2.  connect to the server -> python [irc.py] [server ip address]
